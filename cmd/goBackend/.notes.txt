file description:

            main.go
Initializes the PostgreSQL connection.
Starts the HTTP server on port 3000.

                            models.go
Defines an Account struct (which you plan to replace with a Device struct).
Provides a simple constructor for creating new accounts (to be adapted for devices).


            database.go (Postgres Storage Layer)
Implements database operations (Create, Update, Delete, Get).
Currently interacts with an account table in PostgreSQL.
Needs modification to store and manage IoT/Embedded devices instead of accounts.



                api.go (HTTP Server Layer)
Handles HTTP requests using Gorilla Mux.
Defines API routes (/Account, /Account/{id}) to get, create, delete, and update accounts.
Uses a structured APIServer to manage request handling.
Needs refactoring to work with IoT devices rather than accounts
